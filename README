To test this:

1. Make sure you have PHP 5 with Tidy ( http://www.php.net/manual/en/tidy.installation.php ) and MB_String ( http://ar.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php ) support.
2. Move the folder to an apache dir and access the /examples folder with your browser.

This has been tested so far in PHP 5.3.4.

Known Issues:

. There might be problems with non-ASCII-extending Characted Encodings. If you find this issue report it with a clear explanation of how the problem encoding works or even better yet, some code.
. Base treating of http://www.example.com/dir/ and http://www.example.com/dir is the same. Meaning href="a.jpg" will be translated to http://www.example.com/dir/a.jpg in both cases. I don't know if this is correct or not.

Future:

. Add a construct_by_uri() .. (I need some pages with microdata to test this, come on internets!).
. Add a vocabulary validator framework on top of this.
. I might (I said MIGHT not WILL) port it to C or C++.

PS: This is way clearer than the Microformat parser I did a couple of years ago ("sup Emiliano, We heard you like tree traversing, so we put a tree in your tree so you can traverse while you traverse") . But that's cause Microdata has way clearer syntax than microformats.
