Hi internets, how are you? Hope everything is awesome.

To test just move the folder to an apache dir and access the /examples folder with your browser.

Go on, I'll wait here. 

Now that was pretty cool, right?
Yep, Microdata is kind of awesome that way.

Well, on to serious stuff.

This has been tested so far in PHP 5.3.4 and you need to have tidy and mb_string support enabled.

Known Issues:

. There might be problems with non-ASCII-extending Characted Encodings. If you find this issue report it with a clear explanation of how the problem encoding works or even better yet, some code.
. Base treating of http://www.example.com/dir/ and http://www.example.com/dir is the same. Meaning href="a.jpg" will be translated to http://www.example.com/dir/a.jpg in both cases. I don't know if this is correct or not.

Future:

. Add a construct_by_uri() .. (I need some pages with microdata to test this, come on internets!).
. Add a vocabulary validator framework on top of this.
. I might (I said MIGHT not WILL) port it to C or C++.

Well that's it, bye internets, take care and eat your vegetables.

PS: This is way clearer than the Microformat parser I did a couple of years ago ("sup Emiliano, I heard you like tree traversing, so we put a tree in your tree so you can traverse while you traverse") . But that's cause Microdata has way clearer syntax than microformats.
